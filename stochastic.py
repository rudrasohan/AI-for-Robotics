# --------------
# USER INSTRUCTIONS
#
# Write a function called stochastic_value that 
# takes no input and RETURNS two grids. The
# first grid, value, should contain the computed
# value of each cell as shown in the video. The
# second grid, policy, should contain the optimum
# policy for each cell.
#
# Stay tuned for a homework help video! This should
# be available by Thursday and will be visible
# in the course content tab.
#
# Good luck! Keep learning!
#
# --------------
# GRADING NOTES
#
# We will be calling your stochastic_value function
# with several different grids and different values
# of success_prob, collision_cost, and cost_step.
# In order to be marked correct, your function must
# RETURN (it does not have to print) two grids,
# value and policy.
#
# When grading your value grid, we will compare the
# value of each cell with the true value according
# to this model. If your answer for each cell
# is sufficiently close to the correct answer
# (within 0.001), you will be marked as correct.
#
# NOTE: Please do not modify the values of grid,
# success_prob, collision_cost, or cost_step inside
# your function. Doing so could result in your
# submission being inappropriately marked as incorrect.

# -------------
# GLOBAL VARIABLES
#
# You may modify these variables for testing
# purposes, but you should only modify them here.
# Do NOT modify them inside your stochastic_value
# function.

############## INSERT/MODIFY YOUR CODE BELOW ##################

# You may modify the code below if you want, but remember that
# your function must...
#
# 1) ...be called stochastic_value().
# 2) ...NOT take any arguments.
# 3) ...return two grids: FIRST value and THEN policy.
